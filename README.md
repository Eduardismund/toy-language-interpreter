# Toy Language Interpreter

This project is an interpreter for a custom "toy" language designed for educational purposes, aimed at demonstrating fundamental concepts in language interpretation and execution. It includes a stack-based execution model, a symbol table for variable management, and an output stream to capture printed results.

## Language Overview

This interpreter executes programs in the Toy Language by parsing and evaluating statements sequentially. Programs are built by combining statements, expressions, and variables to perform operations. The language supports essential data types (int, bool, and string), arithmetic operations, logical operations, and a structured flow control.

### Key Language Constructs

#### Statements

A program (`Prg`) is defined by a single statement (`Stmt`). Each statement may be:
- **Compound Statement**: `Stmt1; Stmt2`
- **Variable Declaration**: `Type Id`
- **Assignment Statement**: `Id = Exp`
- **Print Statement**: `Print(Exp)`
- **Conditional Statement**: `If Exp Then Stmt1 Else Stmt2`
- **No Operation (NOP)**: `nop`
- **File Operations**
  - openRFile: Opens a file for reading.
  - readFile: Opens a file for reading.
  - closeRFile: Opens a file for reading.

#### Types

The language supports the following types:
- `int` as `IntType`
- `bool` as `BoolType`
- `String` as `StringType`
- `Reference` as `RefType`

#### Values

Values in this language can be:
- **Integer (IntValue)**: a `numeric constant`
- **Boolean (BoolValue)**: `True` or `False`
- **String (StringValue)**: a `string` value.
- **Reference (RefValue)**: consists of a `heap address` and a `Type` of the location having that address 

#### Expressions

Expressions (`Exp`) include:
- **Value**: a constant, such as `2` or `True`
- **Variable (Id)**: a named variable
- **Arithmetic Expressions**: e.g., `Exp1 + Exp2`, `Exp1 - Exp2`
- **Logical Expressions**: e.g., `Exp1 and Exp2`, `Exp1 or Exp2`
- **Relational Expressions**: e.g., `Exp1 < Exp2`,`Exp1 == Exp2`

# Interpreter Architecture

The interpreter operates with three primary structures:

### Execution Stack (ExeStack)
The **ExeStack** holds statements awaiting execution. Initially, it contains the original program, and statements are pushed and popped as they execute.

### Symbol Table (SymTable)
**SymTable** maps variable names to their associated values. Initially empty, it stores variables declared during execution with their values and types.

### Output (Out)
**Out** captures the values generated by `Print` statements in the order of their execution.

### File Table (FileTable)
The **FileTable** tracks the opened files during the program's execution. It is represented as a dictionary mapping a StringValue (filename) to a file descriptor (BufferedReader). Files are accessed by their string identifiers, and the file descriptors are used for reading data.

### Heap Table (Heap)
The **Heap Table** is a dictionary of
mappings (address, content) where the address is an integer (the index of a location in the heap)
while the content is a Value. Heap must manage the unicity of the addresses, therefore it must have
a field that denotes the new free location. The addresses start from 1. The address 0 is considered an
invalid address (namely null).

---
Each program execution initializes its own unique `PrgState` containing these structures.

## Evaluation Rules

### Statement Evaluation
The interpreter processes statements according to predefined rules. Key rules include:

- **Compound Statement**: Splits `Stmt1; Stmt2` into `Stmt1` and `Stmt2` on the `ExeStack`.
- **Assignment Statement**: Evaluates `Exp`, verifies `Id`â€™s existence and type, then updates `SymTable`.
- **Variable Declaration**: Adds `Id` to `SymTable` with a default value (0 for `int`, `false` for `bool`).
- **Print Statement**: Evaluates `Exp` and appends the result to `Out`.
- **Conditional Statement**: Evaluates `Exp`; if true, executes `Stmt1`, else executes `Stmt2`.
- **NOP Statement**: Simply removes `NOP` from the stack, with no other effect.
- **Open Read Statement:** Opens a file specified by the evaluated expression `exp` and adds the
  file descriptor to the **FileTable.**
- **Read File Statement:** Reads an integer from the file associated with `exp` and stores it in the variable ``var_name`` in the **SymTable**.

- **Close Read Statement:** Closes the file specified by the evaluated string `exp` and removes the entry from the **FileTable**.
- **Heap Allocation Statement:** Allocates memory in the heap for the initialized `RefType` variable `var_name` by evaluating the expression `exp`, with the **Heap** managing references as pointers.
- **Heap Writing Statement:** Updates the heap for the initialized `RefType` variable `var_name` by evaluating the expression `exp`, modifying the **Heap** to reflect the new pointer references.
- **While Statement:** A **while loop** statement that evaluates an expression `exp`; if the expression is a `BoolValue` and evaluates to true, it pushes the `statement` onto the execution stack for repeated execution

---
### Expression Evaluation
Expressions are recursively evaluated, with type checks for:

- **Arithmetic Expression**: Ensures both operands are `int`.
- **Logical Expression**: Ensures both operands are `bool`.
- **Relational Expression**: Evaluates relational expressions and ensures both operands are of compatible types.
- **Heap Reading Expression**: Evaluates the expression `exp` and takes the corresponding address from the **Heap Table**.

---
### Error Handling
The interpreter captures errors such as:

- **Type Mismatch**: Between variable declarations and expressions.
- **Undeclared Variables**: If a variable `Id` is used before declaration.
- **Division by Zero**: Raised when dividing an integer by zero.
- **File Not Found**: Raised when attempting to open a file that doesn't exist or is not accessible.

---
### Garbage Collector

A **garbage collector** is a system or process responsible for automatically managing memory by identifying and reclaiming memory that is no longer in use or reachable. The primary goal is to free up memory resources that are not being used, ensuring efficient memory management and preventing memory leaks.

##### How It Works:
- The garbage collector examines the **symbol table** to find which objects are still being used (reachable). It then identifies the objects in the heap that are no longer referenced and can be safely removed.
- Any unreferenced objects are collected, and their memory is freed, ensuring that the system does not waste memory on unused objects.

This process ensures that the program does not run out of memory and maintains efficient use of resources over time. The garbage collector often runs periodically in the background or when the system detects that memory is running low.
